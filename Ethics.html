    <h1>IT Ethics</h1>
    <p>An important aspect of IT that is often disregarded by larger developers is user privacy. Many major companies such as Google and Meta store data on millions of people daily which is used for a variety of things 
        such as advertising. There have also been several cases of this data being stolen or leaked by hackers, posing a major security risk to users as their PII or personal identifiable information is compromised.</p>
    <p>Listed below are some examples of these types of surveilance and how developers can do better.</p>
    <ol style = "list-style-type: upper-roman;">
        <li><b>Amazon Kindle Data Collection </b>
            <p>As shown in a Communications of The ACM article by Stephen B. Wicker and Dipayan Ghosh titled: <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/research/reading-in-the-panopticon">"Reading in the Panopticon: Your Kindle May Be Spying on You, But You Can't Be Sure"</a>
            Amazon has stated in it's Terms of Use for the Kindle Store that it collects information on user reading habits. This is then used to recommend books for user's to buy. While this on it's own is pretty standard, the article goes into detail on some of Amazon's patents which explain how this type of data is used.
        For example, one of the patents used was for monitoring the rate at which users turned pages.</p>
        <p>It's important for developers to understand that keeping data on this level about users is inherently risky. When you are dealing with user data as well as PII you need to make sure that not only are users informed as to what is being tracked, but that the data you are tracking is also stored securely.</p>
